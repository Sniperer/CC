### How to run
```shell
python3 handin3.py
```
All test sets are included in our code which can be found in function ```test```. Differently from previous assignment, we initialize a class ```circuit``` in ```func``` and call ```circuit.func``` to test.

### Implement
We use encoding as follows.

| blood type | number |
| --- | --- |
| A- | 1,0,0 |
| A+ | 1,0,1 |
| AB- | 1,1,0 |
| AB+ | 1,1,1 |
| B- | 0,1,0 |
| B+ | 0,1,1 |
| O- | 0,0,0 |
| O+ | 0,0,1 |

We have detailed explain about how we implement our program in our code.
